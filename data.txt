⚡ Internet Speed Basics

Network speed is measured in:

Download speed → How fast you can receive data from the internet.

Upload speed → How fast you can send data to the internet.

Latency (ping) → Time it takes for a request to go to the server and come back.

Jitter → Variation in latency over multiple requests.

Usually shown in Mbps (Megabits per second).

📝 Formula for Speed

The basic formula is:

Speed (bps)
=
Data Transferred (bits)
Time Taken (seconds)
Speed (bps)=
Time Taken (seconds)
Data Transferred (bits)
	​


Then convert to Mbps:

Speed (Mbps)
=
Data (bytes)
×
8
Time (ms)
×
1000
Speed (Mbps)=
Time (ms)×1000
Data (bytes)×8
	​

🔎 Example Calculation (Download)

Start a timer (T1).

Request a large file (say 10 MB) from a server.

When the file finishes downloading, stop the timer (T2).

Time taken = T2 - T1.

Speed =

)
/
time in seconds
(10×1024×1024×8)/time in seconds.

👉 If a 10 MB file takes 2 seconds to download:

🔎 Example Calculation (Upload)

Generate random data (say 5 MB).

Start a timer, send it to the server via POST.

Stop timer when upload completes.

Apply same formula.

🔎 Example Calculation (Ping)

Send a tiny request to the server (/ping).

Note the time it takes to get a response.

That’s your ping in ms.

👉 If request takes 40 ms → Ping = 40 ms.

🔎 Example Calculation (Jitter)

Run ping test multiple times.

Find differences between consecutive results.

Average them.

📌 Tools / Code

If you want to measure speed in your own website:

Frontend (JS): use fetch() or XMLHttpRequest to download/upload data and track time.

Backend: provide endpoints for large downloads and uploads.

Math: use the formula above.
